<h2 class = "heady"><i> A little bit about camping:</i></h2>
    <p>There are several beautiful locations in Tennessee to hike and camp. Around <br>the Nashville area, one of my favorite spots is Montgomery Bell State Park. The<br>hike is normally mild to moderate, and one can choose from several options, such as <br>picnics or backcountry camping. <br>

   Another great location in Tennessee is the Virgin Falls. The backcountry camping <br>
 here is much longer and more intense compared to Montgomery, but it's worth it <br>
for the views. It's important to remember, however, that you need to be well <br>
prepared for a hike that takes you miles into the woods, hours from major cities. <br>
 Be aware of trail condtions and weather during your stay and make sure you <br>
 have a means of communication.<br>
