CDs:
<dl>
	<dt>Nightmare</dt>
	<dd>This album was made in light of and as tribute to the recent death of their drummer, James Owen "The Rev". It explores dark themes of death, addiction, and reflecting on ones sin. </dd>

	<dt>Hail to the King</dt>
	<dd> A memorable anthem, its style is inspired by classical bands. The lyrics and message seem to point to the danger of power corrupting someone into the likes of the devil.  </dd>

	<dt>City of Evil</dt>
	<dd>Often regarded as the number one album, City of Evil was a shift into more melodic heavy metal and vocals. City of Evil contains the band's all-time hits and marks the beginning of their turn toward more complex, concise metal. </dd>
